                <center>Community Fridges Cambridge and Somerville</center>
            </h1>

            <p>Due to the pandemic, job economy, housing market, and increasing food prices... food insecurity has
                been
                a major issue for our community. Community fridges and pantries have been made available for the
                public
                to have access to free healthy and fresh food, as well as essential supplies. This resource is to
                help
                bridge the gap between food resources, volunteers, and people in
                need.
            </p>
            <div class="homeicon"><img src="images/icon1.png" width="200px" id="foodgraphic"></div>


            <h1>What Is a community fridge?</h1>
            <div class="center-homebtn">
                <button class="home-button"><a href="location map.html">View a map</a></button>
            </div>


            <p>Community fridges act as a
                grassroots response to a food insecurity crisis. People are
                unable to acquire,
                enough food due to insufficient money or other resources, so fridges and pantries were created to
                help
                serve the community. Covid has increased this need, and also provides a no contact option for those
                at
                high risk. Volunteers help run these locatings, by networking on social media and utilizing sign up
                forms. Each location are given sets of donation rules to ensure the health and safety of the
                consumer,
                and to eliminate the risk of any foodborne illness.
            </p>

            <h1>Why is volunteering important?</h1>
            <p>Volunteers are an essential part of fighting hunger in our community. They stock fridges and
                transport
                items for people struggling to feed their families. Without their support, we simply could not
                feed as many people as we do. We encourage you to contribute to a fridge! You can drop off some
                frozen
                veggies,collect donations from others to re-stock an empty fridge, or help clean and maintain the
                shelves. It is your actions that can make a difference!</p>
